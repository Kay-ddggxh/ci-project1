![responsive mock-up](https://github.com/Kathrin-ddggxh/ci-project1/blob/main/assets/images/responsive-mockup.PNG?raw=true)
Welcome to Lowland Pride! This is the website of the Burren Lowland's first LGBTQ+ youth group. 
The site is targeted towards members of the LGBTQ+ community aged 14-25 who live in the rural areas of the at the base of the Burren, centering on Gort, Co. Galway and reaching into West Clare.
The Lowland Pride's site provides young people with a schedule of weekly meet-ups, dates and information on special events and how to join the group.

## Design

This site was created and designed with young adults and teenagers in mind who are looking for information and access to a very specific group in their own locality. It was built with a mobile-first approach, keeping in mind that most of the target audience would access the site via phone or other mobile device. The content is short and informative, the style colourful and reassuring.

### Wireframes
- The first wireframe in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wT3sdUsGl5XI6l3T6eq9bs/CI-Project-1?node-id=35%3A111) is a very simple design. It also shows an alternative option for the homepage layout which could be implemented in the future.

### Font and Colour choices
**Fonts:** "Irish Grover" was chosen for its Irish theme, given that the site targets a specific rural Irish community. "Nunito", with its rounded edges brings along a soft, gentle yet playful appearance, ideal for young users belonging to a minority group.

**Colours:** A light purple is the main colour of the site, referring to the often represented colour of a lot of pride flags. The general rainbow theme of the pride movement is reflected in the logo and throughout the images on the site.

## Features

This site implements the very basic features of a static website.

### Existing Features
- **Navigation Bar**
    - Featured in the header of all four pages. Includes the club's logo and links to Home page, About page, Events page and Contact form. 
    - Uniform format allows for easy navigation on all pages without the use of the "back" button.

    ![navbar](https://github.com/Kathrin-ddggxh/ci-project1/blob/main/assets/images/readme-images/navbar.PNG?raw=true)

- **Hero image and Banner text**
    - The hero background image and text design is consistent throughout the site, while text content varies to match the page content.
    - The hero image had some opacity added in order to increase the contrast between the header text and the image.

    ![hero section](https://github.com/Kathrin-ddggxh/ci-project1/blob/main/assets/images/readme-images/hero.PNG?raw=true)

- **Main Content**
    - All main sections throughout the site maintain a consistent layout and styling in order to convey information clearly.
    - Subtle borders of the site's primary colour surround each section to give a clear division of information.

    ![main content](https://github.com/Kathrin-ddggxh/ci-project1/blob/main/assets/images/readme-images/main-home.PNG?raw=true)

- **Home Gallery** 
    - A simple gallery of images at the bottom of the hompage adds a visual insight into the club the site is portraying.
    - Images are supposed to show important or fun moments for club members.

    ![events calender](https://github.com/Kathrin-ddggxh/ci-project1/blob/main/assets/images/readme-images/events-calender.PNG?raw=true)

- **Events details**
    - The events details section is located below the events calender.
    - The section explains what activities take place during each event, both regular and special events.
    - An image below every event description offers a visual example of each.

- **Contact form**
    - On the last page of the site users can find a contact form to fill in and submit to get in touch with the club.
    - Name and email are mandotory fields, location and message are optional.
    - Currently, submitting the form will take the user to the form dump page provided by Code Institute.

    ![form](https://github.com/Kathrin-ddggxh/ci-project1/blob/main/assets/images/readme-images/form.PNG?raw=true)

- **404 Error page**
    - In the event of a 404 "page not found" error, the user will be directed to a customized error page which is keeping with the style of the site and also has a little reassuring message.

### Possible Future Features
- Modal for events page:  

    I would like to implement a modal for the calender events. So far, the details of the weekly events are simply listed and explained below the calender. In future it would be nice to have them pop up in a modal when either hovering or clicking on the events in the calender.

- Include loading="lazy" attribute for images

    Once this attribute has full support from all commonly used browsers I aim to include it to all images on site in order to reduce data usage and improve rendering speed.

- Create carousel for homepage gallery

    At the moment the homepage gallery is static. I would like to implement a carousel in the future that would also allow for more images in the gallery.

- Include address and map iframe

    In the event of the club ever getting established, a section will be added to pin the clubs location on a map iframe, as well as the postal address.

### Fixed Bugs
#### 405 Error on form submit
Initially, when clicking the submit button on the contact form, the button would link to submit.html, displaying a "form submit successful" message and a "Back Home" button. On the deployed site this would bring up a 405 error (Not allowed).
As submit.html was not a valid action for form POST method, I had to use the Code Institute form dump provided to students.



### Unfixed bugs
No unfixed bugs to date.
